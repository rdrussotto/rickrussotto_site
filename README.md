# rickrussotto_site
Files for my personal website, <a href="http://rickrussotto.com">rickrussotto.com</a>. 
The site is hosted on AWS S3, where I have been manually
uploading the files to a cloud bucket 
and configuring them for public access.
With AWS Amplify it should be possible to automatically push new commits to the website, 
but I have not set that up yet because it might cost more than my current S3 setup. 
Still, the repo will help me keep track of changes to the site going forward.
